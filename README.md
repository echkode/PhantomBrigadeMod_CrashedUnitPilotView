# CrashedUnitPilotView

A library mod for [Phantom Brigade](https://braceyourselfgames.com/phantom-brigade/) to show the normal pilot view for a crashing unit by holding down the left control key.

It is compatible with game release version **1.2.1**. It works with both the Steam and Epic installs of the game. All library mods are fragile and susceptible to breakage whenever a new version is released.

When you select a unit in the planning phase of combat, normally you'll see the pilot's portrait and a bar with a number below it in the bottom left corner of the screen. The bar and number represent the concussion level of the pilot. However, when a unit is crashing, all you'll get in that space is a unit crashing warning. Here's a screenshot.

With the shipped key bindings, you can hold down the left control key to see a stat overlay for each unit on screen. This mod extends that idea to reveal the concussion level for the selected unit. I figure this fits in with the spirit of the left control key because concussion is a stat on the unit.

The pilot view for units with pilots in other non-functional states remain blacked out.
